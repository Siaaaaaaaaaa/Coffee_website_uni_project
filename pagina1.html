        <h2>Here is some interesting history about coffee!</h2>

        <p>
            Coffee is the most popular beverage in the world, second only to water. It is especially beloved in North and
            South America, Europe, and Australia. However, none of these regions are the original birthplace of coffee.
            The first reliable records of coffee consumption date back to the mid-15th century, in modern-day Yemen.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to legend, coffee was discovered in Ethiopia by a goat herder named Kaldi. He noticed that his goats
            became unusually energetic after eating berries from a certain plant. Ethiopia is widely considered the
            birthplace of the coffee plant.
        </p>

        <p>
            From Ethiopia, coffee spread to the Arabian Peninsula, becoming an important part of social and religious life.
            Coffee houses, known as "qahveh khaneh", became centers for conversation and cultural exchange.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the 16th and 17th centuries, coffee reached Europe. After initial resistance, it gained popularity and
            coffee houses appeared across major cities, shaping intellectual and social life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, coffee is grown in over 70 countries and is an essential part of daily life for millions of people.
